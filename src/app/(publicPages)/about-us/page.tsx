              History
            </h2>
            <p className="text-lg text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
              It all started with Colonel Harland Sanders, the man who convinced
              the world by saying "We do chicken right!" Sanders took a great
              deal of time perfecting his iconic secret recipe of 11 herbs and
              spices, a legacy he&apos;s brought to the world through KFC&apos;s
              10,000+ restaurants. Starting from outside of his gas station in
              Korbin, Kentucky to being a globally recognized face, we owe our
              success to the Colonel&apos;s hard work and passion for sharing
              his love for chicken with the world!
